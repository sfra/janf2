View is based on the system of templates. Template looks as ordinary
html file and are located in the folder application/views/.<br /> Usually their extension is .nhtml.
They are filled by the values defined in config files (located in application/views/config, and have
 .config as extension)<br />
View is in a fact a class which constructor is called in controller. View takes three paramers:<br />
<pre>View('/mview.nhtml','/main.conf',{'color':'#330033'})</pre><br />
The first one is a file of template on which current view is based. The second is a config file
 (however it can equal null, when we do not want to use any ).<br /> The last one parameter is a javascript
object which extends and overrides properties defined in config file<br />
There is another way to define properties of view. Assume that view has been introduced:
<pre>let view = new this._View.View('/mview.nhtml', '/main.conf', { 'color': '#330033' });</pre>
Then the property <i>title</i> can be changed immediately in the following way
<pre>view.getCnf().properties.title = 'Contact us';</pre>
Template contains variables of a few types:<br />
Atomic variables are of the form <pre id="variable"></pre> which are filled by the content defined in config file
<pre>title=Main page</pre>
Lists which occur in template in the form
<pre>&#91;&#91;list 
some content 
          list&#93;&#93;</pre>
Inside the list local variables can occur. This types of variables has the different form, namelly {variable}<br />
If config contains the item
<pre>
list=[{"cont":"hello","col":"#333221"},{"cont":"world","col":"#21ffee"},{"and others":"hello","col":"#033321"}]</pre>
then the template
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;<br />&#91;&#91;unlist &lt;li style="color:{col}">{cont}&lt;/li&gt; unlist&#93;&#93;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
produces
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li style=&#34;color:#333321&#34;&gt;hello&lt;li&gt;<br />&lt;li style=&#34;color:#21ffee&#34;>world&lt;/li&gt;$lt br /$gt &lt;li style=&#34;color:#0333321&#34;>and others&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>

If you want to put the content to a separate file, the folder application/contents/ is for this aim.
When, for example you want to have predefined content<br /> for the action <i>main</i> of the controller
<i>index</i> create, under the mentioned folder, file index.main.chtml. The content of the file
can be associated with the view <br /> in the following way:

<pre>
view.getCnf().properties.content = this.getContent();
</pre>
